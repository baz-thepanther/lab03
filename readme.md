# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

>This branch of computer science started in the field of philosophy and mathematics. Alan Turing is considered to be one of the forefathers when he spearheaded the philosophy of machines thinking like humans. The idea of AI is to update machines with human abilities (cogntive & physical) and beyond.

## Characteristics of AI (Ontology)
AI has mathematics and statistics as the foundation. 
AI has a history in philosophy. 
AI has an application in multiple industries.

### Mathematics & Statistics

#### Probability
The use of probability in AI is to enable the machine make sense from past data and build models on that. Joint probabilities are used to calculate posterior probabilities. Through these probability calculations and bayesian networks, intelligence is modelled and the machine can make sense of the world. The decisions humans make can also be observed as calculating the probability of the possible outcome before the decision is made. This is more so how the machines will also make decisions. 

#### Predicate Logic
Predicate logic is how information from around the world is understood in machine language. Under predicate logic, we have Universal and Existential Quantifiers.

#### Calculus
Calculus is an important aspect of AI because it is deeply used in machine learning. Machine learning is the process by which machines learn from past experiences and build intelligence on how to make better decisions for next actions. Calculus enables the minimization of the cost function hence improving the optimization of a system/AI. 

### History 

### Alan Turing 
Alan Turing was clearly a man ahead of his time. In 1950, at the dawn of computing, he was already grappling with the question: "Can machines think?"
This was at a time when the first general purpose computers had only just been built.The term artificial intelligence had not even been coined. John McCarthy would come up with the term in 1956, two years after Alan Turing's untimely death.Yet his ideas proved both to have a profound influence over the new field of AI, and to cause a schism amongst its practitioners.

### John McCarthy
John McCarthy is an American computer scientist and congitive scientist who coined the term Artificial Intelligence. He also developed the lisp program which has been quite influential in the development of AI. He currently works in MIT and does a lot of frontier research in the field. He worked with Alan Turing to make major advancements in the AI ecosystem. 

### Arthur Samuel
Arthur Samuel is the Engineer who coined the term Machine Learning. He was the first person to effectively implement self-learning programs. This follows a mechanism called alpha-beta prunning. He studied in MIT & UIUC where he continuously developed programs that could become better by a process called rote learning.

### Industry Application 

#### Education
Many educational institutions today are implementing AI software in their educational systems. The advantage: to improve personalized learning, generate smart content and simplifying administrative tasks. With AI, the educational systems can be tailored to better suite the geographical need of a place and curriculums will be adjusted accordingly.

#### Health
Surgeries today are transforming to incorporate more robotic actions that help doctors become more precise at their tasks. In addition, systems are being improved such as clinical workflows and AI is currently being utilized for cancer research. 

#### Agriculture
AI is being applied to optimize farms and help farmers attain higher yields. Genome sequencing is being utilized to cure plant diseases such as a cocoa genome sequencing project under IBM. With the use of AI, farmers will have a better understanding of their farm operations.
